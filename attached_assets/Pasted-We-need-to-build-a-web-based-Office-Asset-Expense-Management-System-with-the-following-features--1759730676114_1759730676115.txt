We need to build a web-based Office Asset & Expense Management System with the following features:

ðŸ”¹ Product & Asset Management

Admin can add all available office products/assets such as:

Desktop systems, laptops

DSLR camera, camera charger

Water cans

Portable printer

Voter list documents

Any other office items

All assets should be displayed in a dashboard view with status (Available / Taken).

ðŸ”¹ Borrowing & Tracking System

Employees can log in with their credentials.

If someone borrows an item (e.g., system, voter list, portable printer):

They must fill out a form with:

Item name

Borrowerâ€™s name (auto-filled from login)

Date & time taken

Due date & time for return

The system should store this entry in the database.

Reminder notifications should be sent to the borrower before the due date to hand over the item.

Items must be marked as Returned once submitted back.

ðŸ”¹ Expense Management

Employees (field staff/field boys) can apply for expenses through a request form.

Expense request fields:

Date

Employee name (auto-filled from login)

Expense type (e.g., travel, food, field expenses, watercan charges, salary for housekeeper, etc.)

Expense amount

Description / Reason

Managers can approve or reject expenses.

Approved expenses should be marked as Pending Payment or Paid.

ðŸ”¹ Salary & Recurring Charges

Track monthly salary for housekeepers.

Track recurring charges like watercan bills.

These should be shown in the expense management section.

ðŸ”¹ Reports & Export

Admin and employees should be able to view:

All borrowed items (current & past)

All expense requests (approved, rejected, pending)

Salary & watercan charge history

Provide an Export to Excel option for:

All transactions

Borrowed items log

Expense details

The exported Excel sheet should be in a simplified, structured format for easy analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Additional Requirements

User-friendly and responsive design.

Role-based access (Admin, Employee).

Notifications/reminders for borrowed items.

Secure login & authentication.
